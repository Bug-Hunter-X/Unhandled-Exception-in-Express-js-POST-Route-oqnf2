This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: the lack of robust error handling in request processing.  The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable POST endpoint that fails silently if the request body is missing or malformed. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling and input validation.  This example highlights the importance of always anticipating unexpected input and handling potential errors gracefully to prevent application crashes and maintain stability.
